# NMockaroo

NMockaroo is a little library that provides an easy way for you to generate mock data based on your C# objects using the Mockaroo API.


## Example Usage

Suppose you have a Person object like this:

```
public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
    public string Role { get; set; }
}
```

Use the library of attributes in NMockaroo to define your Person Schema in Mockaroo:

```
public class Person
{
	[MockarooInfo(Name = "FirstName", Type = DataTypes.FirstName)]
	public string FirstName { get; set; }

	[MockarooInfo(Name = "LastName", Type = DataTypes.LastName)]
	public string LastName { get; set; }

	[MockarooInfo(Name = "Email", Type = DataTypes.EmailAddress, PercentBlank = 40)]
	public string Email { get; set; }

	[MockarooCustomList(
		Name = "Role",
		PercentBlank = 0,
		Type = DataTypes.CustomList,
		Values = new[] { "Super User", "Administrator", "Manager", "Employee" },
		SelectionStyle = "sequential")]
	public string Role { get; set; }
}
```

Then use MockarooClient to generate your mock data:

```
...
var client = new MockarooClient(YOUR_API_KEY);
var people = client.GetData<Person>(10).ToArray();
...

```

Easy peasy.


## Building on your own Machine

NMockaroo is a single assembly designed to be easy to deploy anywhere.  If you prefer to compile it yourself, you will need:

 * Visual Studio 2013 (Community Edition will be fine)
 * Windows 7 or newer
